-- Part 1 : Expression Laws -- (15 test marks, worth 15 Exercise Marks) --------

{-

There are many, many laws of algebra that apply to our expressions, e.g.,

  x + y            =  y + z         Law 1
  x + (y + z)      =  (x + y) + z   Law 2
  x - (y + z)      =  (x - y) - z   Law 3
  (x + y)*(x - y)  =  x*x - y*y     Law 4
  ...

  We can implement these directly in Haskell using Expr

  Function LawN takes an expression:
    If it matches the "shape" of the law lefthand-side,
    it replaces it with the corresponding righthand "shape".
    If it does not match, it returns Nothing

    Implement Laws 1 through 4 above
